mkblog
======

Static blog generation tool using Django templates.

* What

  The whole of mkblog is mkblog.py, a short python script.

* Behaviour

  When run, mkblog.py:

    - determines its configuration
       + attempts to read settings.py in the current directory; or
         falls back to
       + the default values recorded in mkblog.py

    - reads every file under SRC_DIRS and outputs a corresponding file
      under DEST_DIR; output is flat, directories are ignored
        + each file with an INTERESTING_EXTension is run through
          Django's templating system
	+ if a Python module with the same name (but .py extension) is
          present, it is read and the variable context is passed on to
          the templating system

* Settings
  
  All *per-site* settings are saved in settings.py in the directory
  where mkblog.py is run.

  All *system-wide* settings are saved in the mkblog.py script itself
  (don't do this).

  Configuration variables:
    - TEMPLATE_DIRS :: directories where mkblog.py searches for
                       templates
    - SRC_DIRS :: directories of source files
    - DEST_DIR :: directory (note the singular) where the output is
                  saved
    - INTERESTING_EXTS :: list of extensions mkblog.py should consider
         (all other files are ignored)
