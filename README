mkblog
======

Static blog generation tool using Django templates.

* What

  The whole of mkblog is mkblog.py, a short python script.

* Behaviour

  When run, mkblog.py:

    - determines its configuration
       + attempts to read settings.py in the current directory; or
         falls back to
       + uses the default values recorded in mkblog.py

    - reads every file under SRC_DIRS and outputs a corresponding file
      under DEST_DIR; paths are preserved
        + each file is indiscriminantly run through Django's
          templating system
